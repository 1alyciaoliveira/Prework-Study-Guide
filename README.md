# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I've created this project to practice my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As a prework assessment to the Tecnologico Monterrey Bootcamp.

The idea was to create a website to use as a notebook while taking classes. Though all the design was suggested by TEC Monterrey, I was able to create new functions, variables, learn git commands and deploy it.

It was hard to understand some JS concepts and work with the console. But yet, with some debug steps, I've finished it.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website should be used as a online notebook. Each section contains notes about basic development topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. When opening the DevTools console (Right click with your mouse and "Inspect"), you'll see the JavaScript running with the topics I've learned.
